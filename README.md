# RSF RBR Power Steering

This utility is for Richard Burns Rally (RBR) as distributed by [RallySimFan.hu (RSF)](https://rallysimfans.hu). It allows to set the force-feedback (FFB) sensitivity for all cars that you have driven previously, based on the lock-to-lock rotation of the steering wheel and/or the vehicle weight. Additional scaling can be applied depending on drive-train and surface.
